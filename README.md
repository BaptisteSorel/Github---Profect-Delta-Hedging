# Delta Hedging Simulation for a multi-asset portfolio

## Project Summary
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to model and hedge a portfolio containing options on Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) stocks. It calculates the Profit and Loss (P&L) with and without delta-neutral hedging, using historical data and stochastic price paths.

## Description
- **Purpose**: The goal is to demonstrate delta-neutral hedging techniques, simulate correlated stock price movements, and evaluate the effectiveness of the hedging strategy over one year.
- **Skills Utilized**: Python (NumPy, SciPy), Pandas (data handling), Matplotlib (visualization), and Git (version control).
- **Context**: This project was developed as part of a personal finance learning initiative, building on concepts from a finance course, with data analysis and coding applied to real-world stock options.
